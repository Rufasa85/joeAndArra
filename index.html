		<h3 class='slide-in slide-up text-center'>OUR STORY</h3>
		<h4 class='slide-in slide-up text-center'>BEGINNINGS</h4>
		<p class='slide-in slide-up'>First meeting while both working for Metropolitan Market, Arra and Joe quickly
			bonded over their shared love of awful puns. After months of group board game nights (and one legendary
			workplace christmas party), the sparks were flying.</p>
		<p class="slide-in slide-up">Days turned to weeks turned to months, and Joe and Arra realized this was something
			special. While on vacation in Oregon, they confessed thier love to each other. Love was in the air.</p>
		<h4 class='slide-in slide-up text-center'>THE PROPOSAL</h4>
		<p class='slide-in slide-up'>One day, shortly after returning from his sister Rene√©'s wedding, Joe decided he
			wanted to marry Arra. He took her hand, told her how much he loves her, how he could spend every waking
			moment with her and it stll wouldn't be enough(I know, barf barf), and how happy he would be to spend the
			rest of his life with her. She agreed. They can't wait to build their lives together.</p>
